# Prant Clicker
## Overview
This is a my personal practice codebase that aims to learn developing frontend application, especially **state management** and **styling**.   

This repo **does not** have any data fetching features e.g. fetch API or axios.

This repo adopts features below:

- React + TypeScript
- Jotai
- vanilla-extract
- vitest

## Get started

You can run this codebase your local environment.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/abetomoki0420/PrantClicker.git
cd PrantClicker
npm ci 
npm run dev
```

Or, this repo serves a [demo](https://prant-clicker.netlify.app/) which is not so fun.
The demo is powered by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
