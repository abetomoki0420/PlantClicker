This is a my personal practice codebase that aims to learn developing frontend application, especially **state management** and **styling**.   

This repo **does not** have any data fetching features e.g. fetch API or axios.

This repo adopts features below:

- React + TypeScript
- Jotai
- vanilla-extract
- vitest
